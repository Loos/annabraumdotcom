I have monitored threatened and endangered species throughout the Chicago Wilderness Area, and have worked to restore native habitat in areas ranging from Somme Woods to Langham Island in the Kankakee River. I have studied color polymorphism in scarlet paintbrush, the habitat requirements of neotropical migratory birds, and the movements of dragonfly larvae in tidal wetlands. I have a predilection for searching for blue-spotted salamanders in nearby woodlands, or peregrine nests on window ledges.  </p><i>Botanical arrangements</i><p>I bring close attention to each of my <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/annabraumdotcom/annes-lace-and-liatris-in-jar-small.jpg" target="_blank">arrangements</a>, incorporating wild, carefully sourced elements that evoke natural landscapes and seasonal influences.   Native plant communities, ecological assemblies, and principles of composition and color inspire my arrangements.  These arrangements incorporate plants I grow in my own garden in Rogers Park, Chicago, as well as locally sourced flowers from Midwest farms.</p></body>
